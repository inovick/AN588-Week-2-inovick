library("stringr")

```

## Peer Commentary

## Challenge 1
```{r}
v1 <- c("Stately", "plump", "Buck", "Mulligan", "came", "from", "the", "stairhead,", "bearing", "a", "bowl", "of", "lather", "on", "which", "a", "mirror", "and", "a", "razor", "lay", "crossed”)
 
 stringr()
```

## Error: unmatched opening bracket, however, it is matched, so I'm not sure what the problem is.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
